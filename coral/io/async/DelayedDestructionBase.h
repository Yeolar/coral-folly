 * DelayedDestructionBase is a helper class to ensure objects are not deleted

 *
 * This is useful for objects that invoke callback functions, to ensure that a
 * callback does not destroy the calling object.
 *
 * Classes needing this functionality should:
 * - derive from DelayedDestructionBase directly
 * - pass a callback to onDestroy_ which'll be called before the object is
 *   going to be destructed
 * - create a DestructorGuard object on the stack in each public method that
 *   may invoke a callback
 *
 * DelayedDestructionBase does not perform any locking.  It is intended to be
 * used only from a single thread.
